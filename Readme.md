# Straptude Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the Straptude project. The backend is responsible for handling authentication, data storage, map data processing, and caching to ensure efficient data retrieval.

## Project Overview

The backend of Straptude is built to manage the map data storage, user authentication, and efficient data retrieval for the frontend. We are leveraging various technologies to ensure that the backend is robust, scalable, and secure.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The server-side runtime environment for running JavaScript code.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the RESTful API.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store map data and other related information.
- **Firebase**: Used for authentication (Firebase Auth) and storage (Firebase Storage) to manage user credentials and store files securely.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a cache to improve the speed of data retrieval.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for data modeling and schema validation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later)
- **MongoDB** (running instance)
- **Redis** (running instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sagnik2001/map-backend.git
   cd map-backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key
   FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
   REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_url
   ```

## Environment Variables

Ensure you have the following environment variables set up in your `.env` file:

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Firebase project ID.
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key for your Firebase service account.
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`: The client email associated with your Firebase service account.
- `REDIS_URL`: The URL for your Redis instance.

## Running the Project

To start the backend server, simply run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the specified port (default: `3000`), and it will connect to MongoDB, Firebase, and Redis as configured.

## Caching with Redis

Redis is used in this project as a caching layer to improve the performance of the application by reducing the number of requests to MongoDB for frequently accessed data. By caching data in Redis, we can serve data faster and reduce the load on the database.

### Why Redis?

- **Performance**: Redis stores data in-memory, which allows for extremely fast data retrieval.
- **Scalability**: Redis can handle a large number of requests per second, making it ideal for caching in a high-traffic environment.
- **Simplicity**: Redis offers simple commands to set and get data, making it easy to integrate with existing applications.


## Why Caching

   The caching mechanism is implemented using the user ID as the key because each user has separate map data. Since aggregation and sorting are resource-intensive processes, caching significantly improves performance. Additionally, when a user saves new data, the cache is invalidated to ensure that the most up-to-date information is displayed to the user.
